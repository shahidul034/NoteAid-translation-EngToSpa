Bladder distension (overfilled urinary bladder) can cause a firm mass in the lower central abdomen, above the pelvic bones. In extreme cases, it may extend as high as the navel.
Your kidneys help control the acid level in your body by removing it from the blood and sending it to the urine. The acidic substances in the body are counteracted by alkaline substances, primarily bicarbonate.

A trained physician, often a cardiologist, will insert a small needle into the chest between the ribs and up to the thin sac that surrounds the heart (the pericardium). A small amount of fluid is removed.
A temporary increase in calcium usually does not cause side effects. However, receiving higher amounts of calcium over a long period increases the risk of kidney stones in some people.
Children with precocious sexual development are more likely to experience psychological and social problems. Children and adolescents typically want to be like their peers, and precocious sexual development can make them appear different.
Veins and arteries vary in size from one patient to another and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others.
In many cases, this will prevent you from becoming ill. For example, a person who has had chickenpox or has been immunized against it is immune to getting it again. Watch this video about: immune response.
For example, a food that contains 13 grams of fat with a Daily Value percentage of 20% means that the 13 grams of fat represent 20%, or one-fifth, of the total daily recommended amount of fat for a person consuming 2,000 calories per day.
Laparoscopic repair: The surgeon will make 3 to 5 small incisions in the abdomen. They will insert a laparoscope (a thin, hollow tube with a tiny camera at the end) through one of these incisions and other instruments through the remaining incisions.
However, recent studies do not support this idea and suggest that these medications can be used in children with tics who also have attention deficit disorder (which often occurs in the same group of children). There is also a chronic motor tic disorder.
These symptoms are more likely to occur if the skin has been cut or rubbed, as this provides an entry point for the MRSA germ. Symptoms are also more probable in areas with more body hair due to hair follicles.
Some patients develop heart failure and high blood pressure in the blood vessels of their lungs. Their chances of recovery or worsening of the disease depend on the cause and how severe the disease was when it was first diagnosed.

The doctor will perform an examination to look for signs of food poisoning, such as stomach pain and symptoms indicating that the body does not have an adequate amount of water and fluids. This is called dehydration.
An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is a device that can be implanted in the chest wall of individuals who are at risk for this serious rhythm disorder. The ICD can help prevent sudden cardiac death by rapidly delivering an electrical shock when ventricular fibrillation occurs.
A greater respect for the complexities of female sexual function has led to the conclusion that suboptimal female genitals are not inherently better than suboptimal male genitals, even if reconstruction is 'easier.' Additionally, other factors may be more important in gender satisfaction than functional external genitalia.
Regular use -- the user increasingly misses school or work; worries about losing access to drugs; uses drugs to 'fix' negative feelings; begins to distance themselves from friends and family; may switch friends to those who are regular users; shows increased tolerance and ability to 'handle' the drug.
Increased intracranial pressure can be due to elevated cerebrospinal fluid pressure. It may also be caused by increased pressure within the brain tissue due to a mass (such as a tumor), bleeding in the brain, or fluid around the brain, or swelling within the brain tissue itself.

Note: It is often technically easier to treat (and therefore raise) the child as female (it is simpler for a surgeon to create female genitals than male), so in some cases this is recommended even if the child is genetically male.
Deficiency occurs more frequently in women than in men, and is more common in pregnant women and older children. Consuming sufficient iodine in the diet can prevent a form of physical and mental retardation called cretinism. Cretinism is very rare in the U.S. because iodine deficiency generally is not a problem.
People who suffer from an acute herniated disc caused by trauma (such as a car accident or lifting a very heavy object) will receive nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and narcotic analgesics if they have severe back and leg pain. If they have muscle spasms in the back, muscle relaxants are usually administered.
There is a wide range of what is considered 'normal'. Just because your child is in the 15th percentile for weight (which means that 85 out of every 100 children weigh more), this number rarely indicates that your child is sick, not getting enough food, or that breast milk is insufficient for your baby.

This test is conducted during a hospital stay. It indicates the difference between someone who produces urine due to consuming large quantities of liquid and someone who does not. If you have central diabetes insipidus, you will continue to produce a lot of urine even when fluids are not administered.
Additionally, many refined foods, such as white flour, sugar, and white rice, lack B vitamins and other important nutrients unless they are marked as 'enriched.' It is healthier to obtain carbohydrates, vitamins, and other nutrients in their most natural form whenever possible -- for example, from fruit instead of refined sugar.
The pituitary gland near the brain produces too much of the hormone ACTH (called Cushing's disease), which may occur due to excessive growth of the gland, a tumor in it, or a tumor elsewhere in the body (such as the pancreas, lung, and thyroid) that produces ACTH.
In the past, the prevailing opinion was that it was generally better to assign a gender as soon as possible, often based on external genitalia rather than chromosomal gender, and instruct parents so there would be no ambiguity in their minds regarding the child's gender.
Daily concern -- the user loses any motivation; does not care about school or work; exhibits evident behavioral changes; thinking about drug use becomes more important than all other interests, including relationships; the user becomes secretive; may begin trafficking drugs to sustain the habit; the use of harder drugs may increase; legal problems may worsen.
You have sudden and severe chest pain with difficulty breathing, especially after a long trip, prolonged bed rest (such as following surgery), or lack of movement, particularly if one leg is swollen or more than the other (this could be a blood clot that has moved to the lungs).
The mother may simulate symptoms of illness in her child by adding blood to the child's urine or feces, refusing to feed them, fabricating fevers, secretly administering medications to the child to induce vomiting or diarrhea, or using other tricks such as infecting intravenous lines (inserted into a vein) to make the child appear ill.
Because the flow from the left side of the heart is minimal or nonexistent, blood returning to the heart from the lungs needs to pass through the foramen ovale or an atrial septal defect (a passage that connects the collecting chambers on the left and right sides of the heart) toward the right side of the heart.
You can take the tooth to the dentist following one of these tips: Try placing the tooth back in its original position in the mouth so that it is level with the other teeth. Gently press it in place using gauze or a moist tea bag to help keep it there. Be careful not to swallow the tooth.

It is important that the teeth are thoroughly cleaned. This may involve using various tools to loosen and remove plaque and tartar from the teeth.
