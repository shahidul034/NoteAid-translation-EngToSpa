Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate whether the radiology report can fully entail the sentence in the summary. Also generate an explanation for your prediction and the indices of the sentences in the radiology report that support your prediction. Please output '1' or '0', where '1' means the sentence in the summary can be fully entailed by the radiology report, and '0' means the sentence in the summary contains information that cannot be entailed by the radiology report. Generate the answer as a json dict in the format of {'explanation': the reason why the entailment prediction is made, 'provenance': the indices of the sentences in the radiology report that support your prediction, 'entailment_prediction': 1 or 0, whether the sentence in the summary can be entailed}."
