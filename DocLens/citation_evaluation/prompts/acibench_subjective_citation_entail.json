Below is a few conversational turns in the dialogue between the doctor and the patient and a sentence in the clinical note based on this dialogue. Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate whether the conversational turns can fully entail the sentence in the clinical note. Also generate an explanation for your prediction and the indices of the conversational turns that support your prediction. Please output '1' or '0', where '1' means the sentence in the note can be fully entailed by the conversational turns, and '0' means the sentence in the note contains information that cannot be entailed by the conversational turns. Generate the answer as a json dict in the format of {'explanation': the reason why the entailment prediction is made, 'provenance': the indices of the conversational turns that support your prediction, 'entailment_prediction': 1 or 0, whether the sentence in the note can be entailed}."

Also, the doctor asked 'how are you doing with the congestive heart failure' before asking about the diet, which indicates that the diet is related to the patient's congestive heart failure. However, in the provided conversational turns, the patient did not answer whether she is taking her medication, so we are not sure whether the patient is taking her medication and hence the sentence in the note cannot be fully entailed from the conversational turns.",
