Below is a few conversational turns in the dialogue between the doctor and the patient and a sentence in the clinical note based on this dialogue. Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate whether the conversational turns can fully entail the sentence in the clinical note. Also generate an explanation for your prediction and the indices of the conversational turns that support your prediction. Please output '1' or '0', where '1' means the sentence in the note can be fully entailed by the conversational turns, and '0' means the sentence in the note contains information that cannot be entailed by the conversational turns. Generate the answer as a json dict in the format of {'explanation': the reason why the entailment prediction is made, 'provenance': the indices of the conversational turns that support your prediction, 'entailment_prediction': 1 or 0, whether the sentence in the note can be entailed}."
