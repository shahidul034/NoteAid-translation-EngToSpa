Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate whether the clinical note can fully entail the generated translation. Also generate an explanation for your prediction and the indices of the claims in the clinical report that support your prediction. Please output '1' or '0', where '1' means the generated sentence can be fully entailed by the clinical report, and '0' means the generated sentence contains information that cannot be entailed by the clinical report. Generate the answer as a json dict in the format of {'explanation': the reason why the entailment prediction is made, 'provenance': the indices of the sentences in the clinical report that entail any information in the generated sentence, 'entailment_prediction': 1 or 0, whether the generated sentence can be entailed}."
