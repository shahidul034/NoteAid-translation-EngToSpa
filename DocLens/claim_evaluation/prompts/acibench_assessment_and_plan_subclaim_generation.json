        "content": "ASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n\nMartha Collins is a 50-year-old female with a past medical history significant for congestive heart failure, depression, and hypertension who presents for her annual exam.\n\nCongestive heart failure.\n• Medical Reasoning: She has been compliant with her medication and dietary modifications. Her previous year's echocardiogram demonstrated a reduced ejection fraction of 45%, as well as some mitral regurgitation. Her cholesterol levels were slightly elevated on her lipid panel from last year.\n• Additional Testing: We will order a repeat echocardiogram. We will also repeat a lipid panel this year.\n• Medical Treatment: She will continue with her current medications. We will increase her lisinopril to 40 mg daily and initiate Lasix 20 mg daily.\n• Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged her to continue with dietary modifications.\n\nDepression.\n• Medical Reasoning: She is doing well with weekly therapy.\n\nHypertension.\n• Medical Reasoning: She has been compliant with dietary modifications but has been inconsistent with the use of her medication. She attributes elevations in her blood pressure to increased stress.\n• Medical Treatment: We will increase her lisinopril to 40 mg daily as noted above.\n• Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged the patient to take her lisinopril as directed. I advised her to monitor her blood pressures at home for the next week and report them to me.\n\nHealthcare maintenance.\n• Medical Reasoning: The patient is due for her routine mammogram.\n• Additional Testing: We will order a mammogram and have this scheduled for her.\n\nPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.\n"

He presents today with complaints of joint pain.\n\nArthritis.\n• Medical Reasoning: The patient reports increased joint pain in his bilateral knees over the past weekend. Given that his right knee x-ray was unremarkable, I believe this is an acute exacerbation of his arthritis.\n• Additional Testing: We will order an autoimmune panel for further evaluation.\n• Medical Treatment: Initiate Ultram 50 mg every 6 hours as needed.\n• Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient to rest his knees. If his symptoms persist, we can consider further imaging and possibly a referral to physical therapy.\n\nHypothyroidism.\n• Medical Reasoning: The patient is doing well on Synthroid and is asymptomatic at this time.\n• Additional Testing: We will order a thyroid panel.\n• Medical Treatment: Continue Synthroid.\n\nStatus post renal transplant.\n• Medical Reasoning: He is doing well and has been compliant with his immunosuppressive medications. On recent labs, his white blood cell count was within a normal limits and his kidney function is stable.\n• Medical Treatment: Continue current regimen.\n\nPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.\n"
