Also generate an explanation for your answer. Please output '1' or '0' for each claim, where '1' means the claim can be fully entailed by the summary, and '0' means the claim contains information that cannot be entailed by the summary. Generate the answer as a list of json dicts. Each dict should be in the format of {'claim': the original claim, 'explanation': the reason why the entailment prediction is made, 'entailment_prediction': 1 or 0, whether the claim can be entailed}."
