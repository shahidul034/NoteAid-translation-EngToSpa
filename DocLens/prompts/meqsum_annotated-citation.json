[2] I do not have it all over my body. [3] It’s only in my armpits. [4] In the past I’ve gone to doctors and dermatologist they gave me no answers until I looked online today and finally found out what I have. [5] I don’t know maybe I’m wrong. [6] But this disease isn’t even consider common because no one has done anything about it. [7] I’m sure they’re thousands of women with it... [8] Can I be tested for it and help in some kind of way to finding a cure or something? [9] What testing is done for this? [10] And where? [11] Thank you"
