        "content": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nJoint pain [4][5].\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nAndrew Perez is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for a kidney transplant, hypothyroidism, and arthritis [4]. He presents today with complaints of joint pain [4].\n\nThe patient reports that over the weekend, he was moving boxes up and down the basement stairs [5]. By the end of the day, his knees were very painful [5]. The pain is equal in the bilateral knees [5][6][7]. He states that he has had some knee problems in the past, but he believes that it was due to the repetition and the weight of the boxes [10][11]. He states that the pain does not prevent him from doing his activities of daily living [14][15]. By the end of the day on Saturday, his knee soreness interrupted his sleep [14][15]. The patient has taken Tylenol and iced his knees for a short period of time, but nothing really seemed to help [12][13].\n\nThe patient states that he had a kidney transplant a few years ago for some polycystic kidneys [24]. He notes that he saw Dr. Gutierrez a couple of weeks ago, and everything was normal at that time [24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31]. The patient continues to utilize his immunosuppressant medications [32][33].\n\nRegarding his hypothyroidism, the patient states that he is doing well [36][37]. He has continued to utilize Synthroid regularly [38][39].\n\nIn regards to his arthritis, the patient states that occasionally he has pain in his elbow, but nothing out of the ordinary [46][47].\n\nHe denies any other symptoms such as fever, chills, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, and weight loss [16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][40][41].\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\n• Constitutional: Denies fevers, chills, or weight loss [16][17][22][23][40][41].\n• Musculoskeletal: Denies muscle pain [18][19]. Endorses joint pain in the bilateral knees [5][6][7].\n• Neurological: Denies headaches [50][51].\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\n\n• Cardiovascular: 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, stable [58].\n• Musculoskeletal: There is edema and erythema of the right knee with pain to palpation [60]. Range of motion is decreased. Left knee exam is normal [60].\n\nRESULTS\n\nX-ray of the right knee is unremarkable [64]. Good bony alignment [64]. No acute fractures [64].\n\nLabs: Within normal limits. White blood cell count is within normal limits. Kidney function is normal [66][68].\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n\nAndrew Perez is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for a kidney transplant, hypothyroidism, and arthritis. He presents today with complaints of joint pain [4].\n\nArthritis.\n• Medical Reasoning: The patient reports increased joint pain in his bilateral knees over the past weekend [4][5][6][7]. Given that his right knee x-ray was unremarkable, I believe this is an acute exacerbation of his arthritis [64][72].\n• Additional Testing: We will order an autoimmune panel for further evaluation [72].\n• Medical Treatment: Initiate Ultram 50 mg every 6 hours as needed [72].\n• Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient to rest his knees [74]. If his symptoms persist, we can consider further imaging and possibly a referral to physical therapy [74].\n\nHypothyroidism.\n• Medical Reasoning: The patient is doing well on Synthroid and is asymptomatic at this time [36][37].\n• Additional Testing: We will order a thyroid panel [76].\n• Medical Treatment: Continue Synthroid [76].\n\nStatus post renal transplant.\n• Medical Reasoning: He is doing well and has been compliant with his immunosuppressive medications [32][33][34][35]. On recent labs, his white blood cell count was within a normal limits and his kidney function is stable [66][68].\n• Medical Treatment: Continue current regimen [76].\n\nPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan [72][73][74][75][76][77]."
