## How do you compute confidence interval?

To compute the confidence interval for evaluating different prompt strategies, we began by running the model inference five times for each prompt strategy using different temperature settings (0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6). For each run, we calculated standard evaluation metrics: BLEU, chrF++, and COMET. Once all results were collected, we averaged the metric scores across the five runs and calculated the sample mean and sample standard deviation. We then set our confidence level at 95%, corresponding to a significance level of Î± = 0.05. With a sample size of $n = 5$, the standard error (SE) was computed as $s / \sqrt{n}$, where $s$ is the sample standard deviation. Given the degrees of freedom ($df = n - 1 = 4$), the t-critical value from the t-distribution table for a 95% confidence level is approximately 2.776. Using this, we calculated the margin of error (ME) as $t^* \times SE$, and finally, the confidence interval was computed as $\bar{x} \pm ME$. This interval provides an estimate of the range in which the true mean performance of each prompt strategy likely falls, considering variation across temperature settings.
